				<p>Mobile devices came to conquer the planet, and they won. Well . . . mobile devices at least seem to dominate the way in which we access the Web. As a result of the mobile revolution, we no longer have the luxury of deciding whether or not our sites provide a usable experience on smaller screens. In fact, Google is now factoring mobile friendliness into its search rankings.</p>

			<div id="orange">
				<p>In an effort to ensure our sites make the grade, many of us turn to Bootstrap and Foundation. These front-end frameworks provide so much out of the box that it is easy to download them, throw a few class names in our HTML, and call it good without thinking. Unfortunately, these frameworks can be heavy and provide a lot of functionality we neither want nor need.</p>

				<p>If you’re using Bootstrap or Foundation simply for the grid, you have better options. Think of the grid like a bit of tomato sauce. All you want is the sauce. Sadly, you’re getting a whole pizza. What if you wanted to make ravioli? Just pull apart the pizza, hide all the toppings somewhere else, scrape off the sauce, and then you can start. Wouldn’t you rather start with what you asked for–a little sauce?</p>

				<p>If you’ve ever looked for a framework that lets you pick the features you want, doesn’t dictate your design, and keeps your code semantic, Bourbon and Neat may be exactly what you’re looking for. Let’s see how we can ditch the heavy frameworks and take control of our design.</p>

			<div id="blue">
				<p>First things first, Bourbon and Neat are Sass libraries. Unfortunately, this tutorial won’t do you much good if you don’t have a basic understanding of Sass. Fortunately, there are great resources for learning Sass here on Treehouse. Once you start with Sass, you’ll never go back to writing plain CSS.</p>

				<p>One of the great benefits to writing Sass or Less is the ability to use and manipulate Sass or Less libraries and frameworks. At the end of this article, you may decide that Bootstrap or Foundation is still the right choice for your project. The point here is not to disparage those frameworks in any way. I want you to have options. However, if you’re using only the pre-compiled CSS rather than Sass or Less, you’ve already given up a lot of the control.</p>
